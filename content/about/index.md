## Supporting DoY Researchers With FAIRifying Their Data

Dynamics of Youth (DoY) has the ambition to make all projects within the strategic theme as FAIR as possible, i.e. Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. 

The projects and cohorts within DoY can benefit from greater visibility, so researchers can find and reuse data in order to answer a wider range of questions. Datasets could be exchanged or combined to form novel collaborations, start exciting projects, and address pressing issues.

Despite the benefits, the process of FAIRifying youth data can seem daunting. It's difficult to determine which data can be safely shared, with whom, and under which circumstances - particularly when there is (personal) data of minors involved. 

The FAIR data project was set up, in collaboration with RDM Support, with the aim to support DoY researchers to make their data FAIR more easily.
