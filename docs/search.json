Datasets could be exchanged or combined to form novel collaborations, start exciting projects, and address pressing issues.\nDespite the benefits, the process of FAIRifying youth data can seem daunting. It’s difficult to determine which data can be safely shared, with whom, and under which circumstances - particularly when there is (personal) data of minors involved.\nThe FAIR data project was set up, in collaboration with RDM Support, with the aim to support DoY researchers to make their data FAIR more easily."
