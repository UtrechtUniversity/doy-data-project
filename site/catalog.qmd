As we make DoY data more FAIR, we want to list all the datasets in a data catalog to maximize findability. This activity consists of two components:

## DoY Data Roadmap (Survey)

As a short-term goal, we want to build a lightweight overview of data available within DoY. The DoY Data Roadmap can encompass studies that are not FAIRified as well.

This overview begins with a brief Qualtrics survey where researchers can fill out information about their project. The studies will be presented in a standardized way in the overview, so it will be easier to explore. 

Here's a preview of the roadmap, located at []():

## DoY Data Catalog (CKAN)

As a long-term goal, we wish to build a data cataog based on CKAN which can list all of the FAIRified data based on their DOIs or repositories where they have been deposited.
